Triangle_in_Circle
==================

A short project to find out which verticies of a triangle lay within the area of a circle

The algorithm has been implemented using C++ and the GUI is using OpenGL (GLUT).

The algorithm works well. The GUI is only visible if certain inital criteria are met for the co-ordinates of the triangle, circle and radius.
This needs to be rectified by investigating the OpenGL library a little further.
