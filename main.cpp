/*
A program to find which verticies of a triangle are contained within the area of a circle. An algorithm is defined in triangle_in_circle.h in order to 
find this information. A GUI has then been created in GUI_in_openGL.h in order to graphically display the circle and triangle

The algorithm works fine regardless of the numbers you put in. If you want to see the graphical respresentation then certain parameters have to be met
